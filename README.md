# TEKANA E-WALLET Execution Strategy

## Description

A solution for a legacy transaction platform that serves 1 million customers worldwide.

## Team Collaboration and Planning (Day 1 - Week 2)

### Kick-Off Meeting

We must convene all stakeholders (Back-end, Front-end, UI/UX, Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Business SMEs â€“ Small and Medium-Sized Industries) to establish communication channels, project goals, and success metrics.

### Requirements Gathering

Collaborate with the Business team to thoroughly understand existing functionalities, user needs, and non-functional requirements (performance, security).

### System Architecture Definition

Define the high-level system architecture considering scalability, maintainability, and resilience. Explore potential technologies like NestJS, SpringBoot, or other modern frameworks. In this case, I chose NestJS for many reasons:

- I have been using it already, and it provides me with a robust set of tools to write cleaner, more concise code and catch errors before they occur.
- It supports TypeScript, which offers strong typing and improves code maintainability by catching errors early in development. This is crucial for a large-scale financial application like Tekana-eWallet.

### Task Breakdown and Estimation

Break down the project into user stories and epics. Estimate development effort for each user story and create a comprehensive project timeline.

## System Design and Development (Week 3 - Go-Live)

### Database Design

Design an optimized database schema with proper data types, normalization, and indexing strategies to ensure high performance and data integrity.

### API Design

Design a clean and well-documented RESTful API adhering to best practices (clear naming, proper HTTP methods, error handling, versioning, and security).

### Microservices Architecture

Decompose the system into modular, independent microservices for improved scalability and maintainability.

### Development and Code Reviews

Implement functionalities following the chosen framework's best practices. Conduct regular code reviews to ensure adherence to coding standards, readability, and maintainability.

### Unit and Integration Testing

Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for all functionalities to ensure code quality and catch regressions early.

## Deployment and Monitoring (Go-Live - Ongoing)

### Deployment Strategy

Define a deployment strategy for the pilot system, considering rollback options and minimal downtime.

### System Monitoring

Set up monitoring tools to track system health, performance.
